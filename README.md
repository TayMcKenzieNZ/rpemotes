Dear Reader,

If you are reading this message, it is likely due to your previous support of my work or a referral from an individual, such as Noor_Nahas of PopcornRP, who appears to be actively monitoring and sharing community content.

Let's be honest â€” youâ€™re probably here because you want RPEmotes, or because PrinceAlbert is stalking my GitHub activity and has shared a URL (possibly via Wayback Machine) that led you to this very page. I hate to burst your bubble, but there is no script, code, animations, or props here for you, PrinceAlbert, or anyone to steal and enjoy. #WompWomp

This repository serves as a public announcement to inform you that all of my content is now available on my BuyMeACoffee store.

To summarize, several individuals, including PrinceAlbert, collaborated to have me banned from FiveM and the cfx.re forums, Discord, and community. Although my suspension was initially intended to last six months, it was never lifted.

Due to my indefinite ban and the actions of individuals such as Scully, White Customs, various leaking forums, Discord servers, and Noor Nahas of PopcornRP, I have decided to place my work behind a paywall. This decision was made to prevent the unauthorized redistribution of my content and to maintain my motivation despite being unable to share my work with the community.

I have yet to find any content released by PopcornRP that is genuinely original.

If you are in dire need of RPEmotes and wish to support the original creator, you can find them here. I will also be making updates, fixes, and adding new content, which will only be available in the paid resources and not publicly distributed on GitHub where people such as PrinceAlbert can freely claim ownership.

# Frequently Asked Questions ðŸ’¬

**Q.** Since RPEmotes is not on your GitHub anymore, where can I find __**your**__ version?

The **Official** RPEmotes script can be found at mg [BuyMeACoffee Store](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/taymckenzienz/e/235726). You can also find my previously free clothing packs and more on my [ForgeHub Creator Profile](https://forge.plebmasters.de/creators/TayMcKenzieNZ).


-----------------------------------

**Q.** How does it work with the script now being paid and getting updates?

**A.** Due to the script being paid, it is morally unethical of me to charge for silly little updates like adding 2 new emotes or props, therefore the menu doesn't gwt updated as frequently as it once did; instead, I like to add new features, animations and props as one somewhat large update, making it worthwhile of updating, otherwise you are free to stay on the previous version.


---------------------------------

**Q.** I want to make a pull request to fix something, update the translations or add a feature, how can I do this?

**A:** Reach out to me via discord - taymckenzienz / TayMckenzieNZ#4886

---------------------------------

**Q.** You had a discord server. Will that ever return / Do tou have a support discord?

**A.** No. That discord is long gone and I have no plans of reviving it. All of my resources are pretty straight forward to add to your server and run, ao long as you have brain cells and don't poke around touching things you clearly don't know about.


---------------------------------

**Q.** There is another unofficial menu that has XYZ features. Do you plan to add them?

**A.** Android has X, iPhone has Y, Tesla has X, Porsche Taycan has Y, BMW i4 has Z. My point is, not everything needs to be the exact same, however good luck explaining that to someone who takes 5 years of your hard work rather than simply coding an entirely new UI.


---------------------------------

**Q.** Your work was always open sourced and under GNU GPL V3 licensing, why are you soo hell bent?

**A.** I started off modding GTA 5 single player and adding other people's mods to my game. I first got into FiveM and joined ttmost popular advertised server on the client home page at the time, Rockstar Mischief (RSM Freemode). I loved dpemotes but it felt outdated, lacked a ton of animations, props and animal support - I didn't know how to code *(yet alone understand Lua)* but i was determined to learn and figure it out.

I'm still a noob to this day, but a lot of the work that went into making dpemotes into rpemo, before I accepted pull requests and had friends summit features, was all done by yours truly, therefore to have someone take years of my hardwork and claim it as their own under some ridiculous title of being 'reborn', with little to no internal code changes or user interface, who relies on others to fix the provlems myself and my dev team have fixed many months ago, is diabolical. This individual is **not** a developer.

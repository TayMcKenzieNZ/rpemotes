Dear Reader,

If you are reading this message, it is likely due to your previous support of my work or a referral from an individual, such as Noor_Nahas of PopcornRP, who appears to be actively monitoring and sharing community content.

Let's be honest ‚Äî you‚Äôre probably here because you want RPEmotes, or because PrinceAlbert is stalking my GitHub activity and has shared a URL (possibly via Wayback Machine) that led you to this very page. I hate to burst your bubble, but there is no script, code, animations, or props here for you, PrinceAlbert, or anyone to steal and enjoy. #WompWomp

This repository serves as a public announcement to inform you that all of my content is now available on my BuyMeACoffee store.

To summarize, several individuals, including PrinceAlbert, collaborated to have me banned from FiveM and the cfx.re forums, Discord, and community. Although my suspension was initially intended to last six months, it was never lifted.

Due to my indefinite ban and the actions of individuals such as Scully, White Customs, various leaking forums, Discord servers, and Noor Nahas of PopcornRP, I have decided to place my work behind a paywall. This decision was made to prevent the unauthorized redistribution of my content and to maintain my motivation despite being unable to share my work with the community.

I have yet to find any content released by PopcornRP that is genuinely original.

If you are in dire need of RPEmotes and wish to support the original creator, you can find them here. I will also be making updates, fixes, and adding new content, which will only be available in the paid resources and not publicly distributed on GitHub where people such as PrinceAlbert can freely claim ownership.

# Frequently Asked Questions üí¨

**Q.** Since RPEmotes is not on your GitHub anymore, where can I find __**your**__ version?

The **Official** RPEmotes script can be found at mg [BuyMeACoffee Store](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/taymckenzienz/e/235726). You can also find my previously free clothing packs and more on my [ForgeHub Creator Profile](https://forge.plebmasters.de/creators/TayMcKenzieNZ).


-----------------------------------

**Q.** How does it work with the script now being paid and getting updates?

**A.** Due to the script being paid, it is morally unethical of me to charge for silly little updates like adding 2 new emotes or props, therefore the menu doesn't gwt updated as frequently as it once did; instead, I like to add new features, animations and props as one somewhat large update, making it worthwhile of updating, otherwise you are free to stay on the previous version.


---------------------------------

**Q.** I want to make a pull request to fix something, update the translations or add a feature, how can I do this?

**A:** Reach out to me via discord - taymckenzienz / TayMckenzieNZ#4886

---------------------------------

**Q.** You had a discord server. Will that ever return / Do tou have a support discord?

**A.** No. That discord is long gone and I have no plans of reviving it. All of my resources are pretty straight forward to add to your server and run, ao long as you have brain cells and don't poke around touching things you clearly don't know about.


---------------------------------

**Q.** There is another unofficial menu that has XYZ features. Do you plan to add them?

**A.** Android has X, iPhone has Y, Tesla has X, Porsche Taycan has Y, BMW i4 has Z. My point is, not everything needs to be the exact same, however good luck explaining that to someone who takes 5 years of your hard work rather than simply coding an entirely new UI.


---------------------------------

**Q.** Your work was always open sourced and under GNU GPL V3 licensing, why are you soo hell bent?

**A.** I started off modding GTA 5 single player and adding other people's mods to my game. I first got into FiveM and joined ttmost popular advertised server on the client home page at the time, Rockstar Mischief (RSM Freemode). I loved dpemotes but it felt outdated, lacked a ton of animations, props and animal support - I didn't know how to code *(yet alone understand Lua)* but i was determined to learn and figure it out.

I'm still a noob to this day, but a lot of the work that went into making dpemotes into rpemo, before I accepted pull requests and had friends summit features, was all done by yours truly, therefore to have someone take years of my hardwork and claim it as their own under some ridiculous title of being 'reborn', with little to no internal code changes or user interface, who relies on others to fix the provlems myself and my dev team have fixed many months ago, is diabolical. This individual is **not** a developer.

-----------------------------------

Thank you for your understanding and support. if you would like to [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/taymckenzienz) that would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks again,

Tay McKenzie,
Official RPEmotes Project Manager

# <div align="center">RPEmotes üèãÔ∏è</div>

## This is the OFFICIAL repository of RPEmotes. I am not associated with PopcornRP.

RPEmotes <b><i>was</b></i> a community driven FiveM emote menu allowing players to express themselves in roleplay with custom animations, countless facial expressions, walkstyles and props, inspired by [DullPear](https://github.com/andristum/dpemotes). 

Please note that RPEmotes is no longer available from this GitHub repository and is instead hosted on my [BuyMeACoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/taymckenzienz) along with my many other mods.

# Exports 

When using our emote menu with other scripts, using the `TriggerEvent('animations:client:EmoteCommandStart` won't do anything because the events do not exist. These have simply been replaced with the following exports:

```lua
exports["rpemotes"]:EmoteCommandStart(emoteName, textureVariation)
exports["rpemotes"]:EmoteCancel(forceCancel) ‚Äì forceCancel is optional
exports["rpemotes"]:CanCancelEmote(state)
exports["rpemotes"]:IsPlayerCrouched()
exports["rpemotes"]:IsPlayerProne()
exports["rpemotes"]:IsPlayerCrawling()
exports["rpemotes"]:IsPlayerPointing()
exports["rpemotes"]:IsPlayerInAnim()
exports["rpemotes"]:IsPlayerInHandsUp()
exports["rpemotes"]:toggleWalkstyle(bool, message) -- bool to allow the user to change their walkstyle in the menu or not / message to show the user (optional, default is :"You are unable to change your walking style right now.")"
exports["rpemotes"]:toggleBinoculars()
exports["rpemotes"]:toggleNewscam()
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Menu Keybind üéõÔ∏è

The keybind uses RegisterKeyMapping. By default the configured keybind in the *initial* config.lua will be the default key, however once the keybind is set for a user it'll remain and can be changed in the users settings under `Esc > settings > keybinds > fivem`.


**Menu key:**

|COMMAND: | ACTION:|
|---|---|
| F4 | Open / Close  RPEmotes menu |

Server owners can change this in the `config.lua`.

Alternatively, the player base can set their own menu keybind to open RPEmotes

`Esc > settings > keybinds > fivem`

* More keybinds are now using key mappings which means that they are now available in your FiveM settings to change (`FavKeybind` and `RagdollKeybind`)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Keybinds and SQL üéõÔ∏è

To use the SQL features, install the latest version of the [oxmysql](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql) resource and enable the setting in `config.lua`

```lua
SqlKeybinding = false,
```

If you do not want to use the SQL features keep the `oxmysql` region in fxmanifest.lua commented out.

Alternatively, you can use the keybind command that comes with FiveM without having to use SQL, by entering the following into F8:

`bind keyboard "Yourbutton" "e youremote"`. To remove the keybind, type `"unbind keyboard "Yourbutton"`.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Increments 

Pressing 'LEFT ALT' on the keyboard allows players to scroll through the menu one by one, or by 10.

Alternatively, players can use the `SHARE` button on an Xbox controller or `OPTIONS` button on a Playstation controller.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Ragdoll ü•¥

* To enable ragdoll, change `RagdollEnabled = false,` to true in config.lua.

Much like the menu key, `RagdollKeybind` is also using RegisterKeyMapping. It is currently set to `U` by default *(server side)* however can be set to the player's preferred keybind in the FiveM keybinds setting found in the settings menu within the Esc Menu.

* New setting: `RagdollAsToggle`, this will make either the ragdoll be a toggle or a hold key

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Finger Pointing & Hands Up üëÜ

Once enabled, players can press `B` on the keyboard to enable standalone finger pointing, and `Y` to put their hands up, without the need for unnecessary frameworks or "small resources".

Much like everything else in the menu, server owners can change these keybinds to their own preferences.

|COMMAND: | ACTION:|
|---|---|
| B | Toggle Finger Pointing |
| Y | Toggle Hands Up |
| /pointing | Toggle Finger Pointing |
| /handsup | Toggle Hands Up |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Crouching & Crawling

**Crouching:**

RIGHT CONTROL. Players can move forward, back, left and right as well as turning around. Press SPACEBAR to switch from stomach to back. Pressing RIGHT CONTROL key while running will have the player "dive into" a crouching animation.

**Crawling:**

Server owners can opt in to either overriding the stealth / action animation when pressing the LEFT CONTROL keybind or have players tap LEFT CONTROL twice to switch from stealth to crouch (when enabled in the config.lua file)

# Chat Commands

|COMMAND: | ACTION:|
|---|---|
| LEFT CONTROL | Toggle Crouching On / Off |
| RIGHT CONTROL | Toggle Crawling On / Off |
| /crouch | Toggle Crouching On / Off |
| /crawl| Toggle Crawling On / Off |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Moods & Walkstyles üòúüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Moods and walkstyles can be set from the menu. These will save to your character and reapply when exiting a vehicle, or loading back into the server as they are saved via client side KVP.

|COMMAND: | ACTION:|
|---|---|
| F4 | Opens RPEmotes menu |
| /walks | See A List Of Walkstyles In Chat |
| /moods | See A List Of Walkstyles In Chat |
| /reset mood | Remove preferred mood and set default |
| /reset walk | Remove last walkstyle and set default |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# No Idle Cam üì∑

No Idle Cam allows players to disable the idle camera animation on foot and in vehicle, making RP scenarios, streaming on Twitch, or just general gameplay just a little more enjoyable.

|COMMAND: | ACTION:|
|---|---|
| /Idlecamon | deactivates the native|
| /idlecamoff | enables the native|


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Binoculars üëÄ

|COMMAND: | ACTION:|
|---|---|
| /binoculars | starts the binoculars|
| L ALT | Toggle between night, heat and normal visions |
| G | Show or hide the instructions |
| BACKSPACE | Exit the binoculars |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# News Camera 

|COMMAND: | ACTION:|
|---|---|
| /newscam | starts the News Camera |
| H |  Edit Text |
| L ALT | Toggle between vision modes |
| G | Show or hide the instructions |
| BACKSPACE | Exit News Camera |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Favorite Emote

Players can search for an emote (so long as search is enabled) and press LEFT SHIFT and CAPLOCKS on their keyboard to add it to their 'Favorites'. Pressing CAPLOCKS will toggle the emote.

Alternatively, you can use the üåü Favorite menu to find an emote and press enter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exit Emotes

Exit Emotes are used to make cancelling an animation more smoother and dynamic, such as getting up off a chair or throwing a cigarette out instead of dropping it.

You can add your own Exit Emotes under `AnimationListCustom.lua`'s new `CustomDP.Exits = {}` array.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Adult Emotes üîû

Adult Emotes can be hidden from the menu by setting `AdultEmotesDisabled` to `true` in the config.lua file.

This will completely conceal the emotes from the lists *(Emotes, Shared Emotes, etc)* at startup making them unusable. Alternatively, you can also hide animal emotes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Prop Extractor ‚ÜîÔ∏è

Many people have expressed concerns over anticheat scripts kicking or banning their community members due to the fact RPEmotes uses props and anticheats detecting said props being spawned.

To make server owners' jobs a little easier, we have added a prop extractor command that you can enter into the server console which will automate a file inside the RPEmotes resource folder appropriately named, `prop_list.lua`.

### Command:

`emoteextract`

```lua

Available output formats:
1 - 'prop_name',
2 - "prop_name",
3 - prop_name

Command usage example: emoteextract 1
```

if you would like to visually see the props that are present in RPEmotes *(minus custom made and provided content)*, you can see them [here](https://forge.plebmasters.de/account?tab=datalists&datalist=1abf505b-23b3-493a-31a2-08dbd7a05cc3&type=Object) thanks to [DurtyFree](https://github.com/DurtyFree) and the Plebmaster's team ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Installation Instructions ‚öôÔ∏è:

* Add `ensure rpemotes` to your `server.cfg`

* Download the latest recommended artifacts [for Windows](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) or [for Linux](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/)

* [Enforce gamebuild to latest build](https://forum.cfx.re/t/tutorial-forcing-gamebuild-to-casino-cayo-perico-or-tuners-update/4784977) for all emotes and props to work as intended.

**Onesync Infinity is required for the particle effects to work as intended** This can be done via txadmin or your localhost .bat file.**

For localhost servers, comment out onesync from your server.cfg and add the following to your `.bat` file:

```lua

+set onesync on +set onesync_enableInfinity 1 +set onesync_enableBeyond 1 +set onesync_population true

```

You can put this before your gamebuild enforcement, aka `+set sv_enforceGameBuild XXXX`

* Set the desired language and settings in the config.lua under `MenuLanguage = 'en',`

* Qb-Core server owners, set `Framework = 'qb-core'` in the config file, otherwise leave it as false.

* To use the SQL features, install the [oxmysql](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql) resource then open `keybinds.lua` in RPEmotes. If you do not want to use the SQL features, comment out the `oxmysql` region in fxmanifest.lua.

Alternatively, you can use the keybind command that comes with FiveM without having the SQL, by entering the following into F8:

`bind keyboard "Yourbutton" "e youremote"`. To remove the keybind, type `"unbind keyboard "Yourbutton"`.

* Type `/refresh` and `/start rpemotes` into your chat resource, or simply restart your server
